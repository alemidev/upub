# mdhtml

> batteries-included opinionated html escaping and markdown parsing

basically anything you may need to sanitize html before displaying it, and converting user generated markdown into safe html

this is probably only useful for [upub](https://join.upub.social), and it was made a standalone crate to be shared across components
